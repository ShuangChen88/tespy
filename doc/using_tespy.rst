 * tespy.connections and
 * tespy.network_reader.

At the end of this page we give a brief overview how TESPy handles fluid properties.

Introduction
============

Set up a plant
--------------

In order to simulate a plant you will have to create a tespy.network first. The network is the main container for the model.

You need to specify a list of the fluids you need for the calculation in your plant. For more information on the fluid properties jump to the :ref:`bottom of this page <tespy_fluid_properties_label>`.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy import nwk
	# create a network object with air and water as fluids
	fluid_list = ['air', 'water']
    my_plant = nwk.network(fluids=fluid_list)

On top of that, it is possible to specify a unit system and value ranges for the networks variables. If you do not specify these, TESPy will use SI-units.
The specification of the value range is used to improve convergence stability.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy import nwk
	
	# set the unitsystem for temperatures to Â°C, for pressure to bar and enthalpy to kJ / kg
	my_plant.set_attr(T_unit='C', p_unit='bar', h_unit='kJ / kg')
	my_plant.set_attr(T_range=[10, 700], p_range=[0.05, 150], h_range=[15, 4000])

Now you can start to create the components of the network.

Set up components
-----------------

Available components can be found :ref:`here <using_tespy_components_label>`. If you set up a component you have to specify a (within one network) unique label.
Moreover, it is possible to specify parameters for the component, for example power P for a turbine or upper terminal temperature difference ttd_u of a heat exchanger.
The full list of parameters for a specific component (e. g. a vessel) is stated in the classes documentation.

.. note::
	Parameters for components are generally optional. Only the components label and in case you want to use a combustion chamber, the combustion chambers fuel, are mandatory parameters to provide.
	If an optional parameter is not specified by the user, it will be a result of the plants simulation. In this way, the set of equations a component returns is determined by which parameters you specify.
	You can find all equations in the :ref:`components documentation <using_tespy_components_label>` as well. The example below shows how to create a component with specific parameters, set or reset and how to unset a parameter:

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import cmp
	feed_water_pump = cmp.pump(label='hp pump', P=1e3) # create pump labeled 'hp pump'
	feed_water_pump.set_attr(P=2e3, eta_s=0.9) # set the power to 2000 W, set isentropic efficiency to 90 %
	feed_water_pump.set_attr(P=math.nan) # unset power
	
After setting up the components the next step is to connect the components in your network.

Establish connections
---------------------

Connections are used to link two components (outlet of component 1 to inlet of component 2, source to target).
If two components are connected to each other the fluid properties at the source will be equal to the properties at the target.
It is possible to set the properties on each connection in a similar way as parameters are set for components. You may specify:

 * mass flow* (m),
 * pressure* (p),
 * enthalpy* (h),
 * temperature* (T),
 * vapour mass fraction for pure fluids (x),
 * a fluid vector (fluid) and
 * a balance closer for the fluid vector (fluid_balance).

All parameters but the fluid vector have to be numeric values. The fluid vector has to be specified as dictonary, see the example below.
The parameter :code:`fluid_balance` can only be :code:`True` or :code:`False`. For the properties marked with * it is possible to use references instead of numeric values.
This can be used for example if you want to have the pressure in two parts of your network related in a specific way but you do not know the values prior to the plant simulation.

.. code-block:: python
	
	from tespy import con
	ws_cond = con.connection(waste_steam_source, 'out1', condenser, 'in1', x=0.97) # waste steam source to condenser hot side inlet and setting vapour mass fraction
	cond_cp = con.connection(condenser, 'out1', condensate_pump, 'in1', fluid={'water': 1, 'air': 0}) # setting a fluid vector: {'fluid i': mass fraction i}
	cp_fwt = con.connection(condensate_pump, 'out1', feed_water_tank, 'in1')
	fwt_fwp = con.connection(feed_water_tank, 'out1', feed_water_pump, 'in1') # connection without parameter specification
	fwp_eco = con.connection(feed_water_pump, 'out1', economiser, 'in2', p=150) #  setting pressure
	eco_drum = con.connection(economiser, 'out2', drum, 'in1', T=320, p=con.ref(d, 0.98, 0)) # setting temperature and pressure via reference object
	eva_eco = con.connection(evaporator, 'out1', economiser, 'in1', T=350, m=100) # setting temperature and mass flow
	eco_fgs = con.connection(economiser, 'out1', flue_gas_sink, 'in1', fluid_balance=True, fluid={'air': 1}, p=1) # setting fluid vector partially as well as the fluid balance parameter and pressure
	
	# this line is crutial, you have to add all connections to your network!
	my_plant.add_conns(ws_cond, cond_cp, cp_fwt, fwt_fwp, fwp_eco, eco_drum, eva_eco, eco_fgs)

.. figure:: api/_images/intro_connections.svg
    :align: center
	
    Figure 2: Topology after defining the above connections.

If you want to set, reset or unset a connection parameter the same logic as for the components is applied.

.. code-block:: python

	ws_cond.set_attr(x=0.95, p=0.05) # reset vapour mass fraction, set pressure
	fwp_eco.set_attr(p=math.nan) # unset pressure	

Start your calculation
----------------------

After building your network, the components and the connections, add the following line at the end of your script and off you go:

.. code-block:: python

	my_plant.solve(mode='design')
	
Please be aware, that the execution of the lines of code above will not create a solvable TESPy network. For good first examples jump to the :ref:`TESPy examples <tespy_examples_label>`.

In order to get a good overview of the TESPy functionalities, the following sections will walk you through the different TESPy modules in detail.


.. _using_tespy_networks_label:

TESPy networks
==============

The tespy.networks.network class handles preprocessing, solving and postprocessing. We will walk you through all the important steps.

Setup
-----

Network container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TESPy network contains all data of your plant, which in terms of the calculation is represented by a nonlinear system of equations. The system variables of your TESPy network are:

 * mass flow,
 * pressure,
 * enthalpy and
 * the mass fractions of the network's fluids.

The solver will solve for these variables. As stated in the introduction the list of fluids is passed to your network on creation.
You should **always make use of the value ranges** of the system variables, like in the code block below. This improves the stability of the algorithm. Try to fit the boundaries as tight as possible,
for instance, if you kwow that the maximum pressure in the system will be at 10 bar, use it as upper boundary. You should **always state ranges for pressure and enthalpy**, temperature is optional.
Value ranges for mass flow and fluid composition are not necessary, as these are handeled automatically.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy import nwk
	
	fluid_list = ['air', 'water']
    my_plant = nwk.network(fluids=fluid_list)
	my_plant.set_attr(p_unit='bar', h_unit='kJ / kg')
	my_plant.set_attr(p_range=[0.05, 10], h_range=[15, 2000])
	
Prior to solving the network there are options regarding the console printouts using the :py:class:`set_printoptions method <tespy.networks.network.set_printoptions>`. 
You can choose the print_level (info, warn, err, none), or specify the printouts individually. Check out the :py:class:`documentation <tespy.networks.network.set_printoptions>` for all options.

.. code-block:: python

	myplant.set_printoptions(print_level='info')
	
As seen in the introduction, you will have to create your networks from the components and the connections between them.
Add all connections, subsystems and busses you want to use in your network with the following methods:

.. code-block:: python

	myplant.add_conns()
	myplant.add_busses()
	myplant.add_subsys()
	
You do not need to add the components to the network, as they are inherited via the added connections.
After having set up your network and added all required elements, you can start the calculation.

Start calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start the solution process with the following line:

.. code-block:: python

	myplant.solve(mode='design')
	
This starts the initialisation of your network and proceeds to its calculation. The specification of the calculation mode is mandatory, see the list of available keywords:

 * :code:`init_file` is the .csv-file you want to use for initialisation,
 * :code:`design_file` is the .csv-file which holds the information of your plants design point,
 * :code:`mode` is the calculation mode (design-calculation or offdesign-calculation),
 * :code:`max_iter` is the maximum amount of iterations performed by the solver,
 * :code:`parallel` parallel computation (True/False) and
 * :code:`init_only` stop after initialisation (True/False).

There are two calculation modes available (:code:`'design'` and :code:`'offdesign'`), which are explained in the subsections below.
If you choose :code:`offdesign` as calculation mode the specification of a design_file is mandatory.

The usage of an initialisation file is always optional but highly recommended, as the convergence of the solution process will be improved.
If do not specify an :code:`init_file`, the initialisation from .csv-file will be skipped.
Parallel computation can improve the calculation velocity of very large networks or networks with a large number of fluids (if used for mixtures). **Parallel code execution does not work on windows at the moment!**
:code:`init_only=True` usually is used for debugging. You could use this feature to export a not solved network, if you want to do the parametrisation in .csv-files rather than your python script.

Design mode
+++++++++++

The design mode is used to design your system and is always the first calculation of your plant. **The offdesign calculation is always based on a design calculation!**.
Obviously as you are designing the plant the way you want, you are flexible to choose the parameters to specify.
However, you can't specify parameters that are based on a design case, as for example the isentropic efficiency characteristic function of a turbine or a pump. Specifying a value for the efficiency is of course possible.

Offdesign mode
++++++++++++++

The offdesign mode is used to **calulate the performance of your plant, if parameters deviate from the plant's design point**. This can be partload operation, operation at different temperature or pressure levels etc..
Thus, before starting an offdesing calculation you have to design your plant first. By stating :code:`'offdesign'` as calculation mode, **components and connections will auto-switch to the offdesign mode.**
For components, this means that all parameters provided in :code:`component.design` will be unset and instead all parameters provided in :code:`component.offdesign` will be set.
This applies to connections analogously. **The value of the newly set parameter is always equal to the value from the design case (or based on it for characteristics).**

.. code-block:: python

	myplant.solve(mode='design', design_file='design_results.csv', init_file='design_results.csv')


The default design and offdesign parameters for components can be found in the components documentation. For connections, there are no default design and offdesign parameters.
You can specify custom design and offdesign parameters for components and connections. For example, for a condenser you would usually design it to a maximum terminal temperature difference, in offdesign the heat transfer coefficient
is selected. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated in the preprocessing of the offdesign case based on the results of the design-case. Of course, this applies to all other parameters in the same way.
Also, the pressure drop is a result of the geometry for the offdesign case, thus we swap the pressure ratios with zeta values.

.. code-block:: python

	heat_ex.set_attr(design=['ttd_u', 'pr1', 'pr2'], offdesign=['kA', 'zeta1', 'zeta2'])
	
If you want to **prevent the autoswitch from design to offdesign mode** for specific components, use :code:`heat_ex.set_attr(mode='man')`.
	
For connections it works in the same way, e. g. write

.. code-block:: python

	connection.set_attr(design=['h'], offdesign=['T'])
	
if you want to replace the enthalpy with the temperature for your offdesign. **The temperature is a result of the design calculation and that value is then used for the offdesign calculation in this example.**
	
The table below contains frequently used offdesign parameters of the available components.

Solving
-------

A TESPy network can be represented as a linear system of nonlinear equations, consequently the solution is obtained with numerical methods.
TESPy uses the n-dimensional NewtonâRaphson method to find the systems solution, which may only be found, if the network is parameterized correctly.
**The number of variables n** is :math:`n = num_{conn} \cdot (3 + num_{fluids})`.

The algorithm requires starting values for all variables of the system, thus an initialisation of the system is runned prior to calculating the solution.
**High quality initial values are crutial for convergence speed and stability**, bad starting values might lead to instabilty and diverging calculation can be the result.
Thus there are different levels for the initialisation.

Initialisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initialisation is performed in the following steps.

**General preprocessing:**

 * check network consistency and initialise components (if network topology is changed to a prior calculation only),
 * perform design/offdesign switch (for offdesign calculations only)

**Finding starting values:**

 * fluid propagation,
 * fluid property initialisation,
 * initialisation from .csv (preprocessing with design_file for offdesign case and setting starting values with init_file).

The network check is used to find errors in the network topology, the calulation can not start without a successful check. The component initialisation is important for components using charactersitcs and the combustion chamber,
a preprocessing of some parameters is required. The preprocessing for the components is performed in the :code:`comp_init` method of the components.
You will find the methods in the :py:class:`components module <tespy.components.components>`. The design/offdesign switch is described in the network setup section.

**The fluid propagation is a very important step in the initialisation:** Often, you will specify the fluid at one point of the network only, thus all other connections are missing an initial information on the fluid vector,
if you are not using an init_file. Also, you do not want to state a starting value for the fluid vector at every point of the network. The fluid propagation will push/pull the specified fluid through the network.
If you are using combustion chambers these will be starting points and a generic flue gas composition will be calculated prior to the propagation.

.. note::
	If the fluid propagation fails, you often experience an error, where the fluid property database can not find a value, because the fluid is 'nan'. Providing starting values manually can fix this problem.

The fluid property initialisation takes the user specified starting values if available and otherwise uses generic starting values on the bases of to which components the connection is linked to.

Last step is the initialisation from an init_file: For offdesign cases a preprocessing based on the design_file in order to recreate the design case and set parameters based on the design case is performed.
If you specified an init_file TESPy searches through that file for the network topology and if the corresponding connection is found, the starting values for the system variables are extracted from that file.
**The file does not need to contain all connections of your network, thus you can build up your network bit by bit and initialise the existing parts of your network from the .csv-file.**
**Be aware that a change within the fluid vector does not allow this practice.** Thus, if you plan to use additional fluids in parts of the network you have not touched until now, you will need to state all fluids from the beginning.

.. note::

	Initialisation from a converged calculation usually yields the best performance and is highly receommended.
	In order to initialise your calculation from a .csv-file, you need to provide its filename. If you saved your calculation restults you will find the file 'savename/results.csv'.


Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^

In this section we will give you an introduction to the implemented solution algorithm.

NewtonâRaphson method
+++++++++++++++++++++

The NewtonâRaphson method requires the calculation of residual values for the equations and of the partial derivatives to all system variables (jacobian matrix).
In the next step the matrix is inverted and multiplied with the residual vector to calculate the increment for the system variables.
This process is repeated until every equation's result in the system is "correct", thus the residual values are smaller than a specified error tolerance. All equations are of the same structure:

.. math::

	0 = \text{expression}
	
calculate the residuals

.. math::
	
	f(\vec{x}_i)

jacobian matrix J

.. math::
	J(\vec{x})=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
	\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\ 
	\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n} \\ 
	\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}
	\end{array}\right)
	
derive the increment

.. math::
	\vec{x}_{i+1}=\vec{x}_i-J(\vec{x}_i)^{-1}\cdot f(\vec{x}_i)
	
while

.. math::
	||f(\vec{x}_i)|| > \epsilon
	
.. note::

	You have to provide the exact amount of required parameters (neither less nor more) and the parametrisation must not lead to linear dependencies.
	Each parameter you set for a connection and each energy flow you specify for a bus will add one equation to your system.
	On top, each component provides a different amount of basic equations plus the equations provided by your component specification.
	For example, setting the power of a pump results in an additional equation compared to a pump without specified power:

.. math::
	\forall i \in \mathrm{network.fluids} \, &0 = fluid_{i,in} - fluid_{i,out}\\
											 &0 = \dot{m}_{in} - \dot{m}_{out}\\
					 \mathrm{additional:} \, &0 = 1000 - \dot{m}_{in} (\cdot {h_{out} - h_{in}})

.. _using_tespy_convergence_check_label:

Convergence stability
+++++++++++++++++++++

One of the main downsides of the NewtonâRaphson method is that the initial stepwidth is very large and that it does not know physical boundaries,
for example mass fractions smaller than 0 and larger than 1 or negative pressure. Also, the large stepwidth can adjust enthalpy or pressure to quantities that are not covered by the fluid property databases.
This would cause an inability e. g. to calculate a temperature from pressure and enthalpy in the next iteration of the algorithm. In order to improve convergence stability, we have added a convergence check.

**The convergence check manipulates the system variables after the increment has been added** (if the system variable's value is not user specified). This manipulation has four steps, the first is always applied:

 * cutting off mass fractions smaller than 0 and larger than 1: This way a mass fraction of a single fluid components never exceeds these boundaries.

The next three steps are applied, if the user did not specify an init_file and the iteration count is lower than 3, thus in the first three iteration steps of the algorithm only. In other cases this convergence check is skipped.

 * Check, if the fluid properties (pressure, enthalpy and temperature) are within the user specified boundaries (:code:`p_range, h_range, T_range`) and if not, cut off higher/lower values.
 * Check the fluid properties of the connections based on the components they are connecting. E. g. check if the pressure at the outlet of a turbine is lower than the pressure at the inlet or if the flue gas composition at a combustion chamber's
   outlet is within the range of a "typical" flue gas composition. If there are any violations, the corresponding variables are manipulated. If you want to look up, what exactly the convergence check for a specific component does,
   look out for the :code:`convergence_check` methods in the tespy.components.components module.
 * A second check of the fluid properties towards the specified boundaries to cut off bad values generated by the component convergence check.

In most cases the algorithm has found a near enough solution after the third iteration, further checks are usually not required.

Troubleshooting
+++++++++++++++

In this section we show you how you can troubleshoot your calculation and list up common mistakes.

First of all, make sure your network topology is set up correctly, TESPy will prompt an Error, if not.
Also, TESPy will prompt an error, if you did not provide enough or if you provide too many parameters for your calculation, but at the moment you will not be given an information which parameters are under- or overdetermined.

.. note::
	Always keep in mind, that the system has to find a value for mass flow, pressure, enthalpy and the fluid mass fractions. Try to build up your network step by step and have in mind, what parameters will be determined
	by adding an additional component without any parametrisation. This way, you can easily find out, which parameters are still to be determined.

When using multiple fluids in your network, e. g. water, air and methane and at some point you want to have water only, you still need to specify the mass fractions for both air and methane (although beeing zero) at that point.
Also, setting :code:`fluid={water: 1}, fluid_balance=True` will still not be sufficent, as the fluid_balance parameter adds only one equation to your system.

.. note::
	
	If you are modeling a cycle, e. g. the clausius rankine cylce, you need to make a cut in the cycle using a sink and a source not to overdetermine the system. Have a look in the :ref:`heat pump tutorial <heat_pump_tutorial_label>`
	to understand why this is important.

If you have provided the correct number of parameters in your system and the calculations stops after or even before the first iteration, there are four frequent reasons for that:

 * Sometimes, the fluid property database does not find a specific fluid property in the initialisation process, have you specified the values in the correct unit?
 * Also, fluid property calculation might fail, if the fluid propagation failed. Provide starting values for the fluid composition, especially, if you are using drums, merges and splitters.
 * A linear dependency in the jacobian matrix due to bad parameter settings stops the calculation (overdetermining one variable, while missing out on another).
 * A linear dependency in the jacobian matrix due to bad starting values stops the calculation.

The first reason can be eleminated by carefully choosing the parametrisation. **A linear dependendy due to bad starting values is often more difficult to resolve and it may require some experience.**
In many cases, the linear dependency is caused by equations, that require the **calculation of a temperature**, e. g. specifying a temperature at some point of the network, terminal temperature differences at heat exchangers, etc..
In this case, **the starting enthalpy should be adjusted in a way, that the fluid state is not within the two-phase region:** The specification of temperature and pressure in a two-phase region does not yield a distict value for the enthalpy.
Even if this specific case appears after some iterations, better starting values often do the trick.

Did you experience other errors frequently and have a workaround/tips for resolving them? You are very welcome to contact us and share your experience for other users!

Postprocessing
--------------

A postprocessing is performed automatically after the calculation finished. You have two further options:

 * print the results to prompt (:code:`nw.print_results()`) and
 * save the results in a .csv-file (:code:`nw.save('savename')`).

You can print the components and its properties to the prompt and the connections and its properties as well. If you choose to save your results in a .csv-file, open the file and look up the **connection parameters in the results file**.
**If you want to export up the parameters of the components, too, you have to save the network structure.** In order to do this, add this line to your code: :code:`nw.save('savename', structure=True)`.
In both cases TESPy will create a new folder 'savename' in your working directory containing the results.csv file and subfolders with the component results.

In order to perform calculations based on your results, you can access all components' and connections' parameters:

For the components this is the way to go

.. code:: python

	eff = mycomp.eta_s.val # isentropic efficiency of mycomp
	s_irr = mycomp.Sirr.val # entropy production of mycomp due to irreveribility
	
Use this code for connection parameters:

.. code:: python

	mass_flow = myconn.m.val # value in specified network unit
	mass_flow_SI = myconn.m.val_SI # value in SI unit
	mass_fraction_oxy = myconn.fluid.val['O2'] # for the mass fraction of oxygen
	
Additionally TESPy can calculate cycle process performance figures for you, if you define busses with the labels 'P_res' (components with power input/output) and 'Q_diss'
(add components with heat input/output for total dissipated heat) in your network: Thermal efficiency for a right-handed process, COP for left-handed processes.

Component parametrisation
-------------------------

Component parameters can be set and accessed in various ways. All parameters of components are objects of a data_container class. The data container for component parameters it is called dc_cp and dc_cc for component characteristics.
The main purpose of having a data container for the parameters (instead of pure numbers), is added flexibility for the user.

There are different ways for you to specify a component parameter, we use a heat exchanger as an example.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import cmp, hlp
	import numpy as np
	
	he = cmp.heat_exchanger('evaporator')
	
	# ways to specify (and set) value
	he.set_attr(kA=1e5)	
	# specify data container (same result as above)
	he.set_attr(kA=hlp.dc_cp(val=1e5, is_set=True))
		
	# ways to unset value
	he.set_attr(kA=np.nan)
	he.kA.set_attr(is_set=False)
	
	# to come in TESPy v0.0.4
	pipe = cmp.pipe('my pipe')
	
	# make diameter variable of system
	pipe.set_attr(D='var')
	# data container specification with identical result,
	# benefit: val is the starting value in this case
	pipe.set_attr(D=hlp.dc_cp(val=0.2, is_set=True, is_var=True))
	
	
Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import cmp, hlp
	import numpy as np
	
	he = cmp.heat_exchanger('evaporator')
	
	# specify name of predefined method
	he.set_attr(kA_char1='EVA_HOT')
	he.set_attr(kA_char2='EVA_COLD')
	
	# specify data container (yields same result)
	he.set_attr(kA_char1=hlp.dc_cc(method='EVA_HOT', param='m'))
	
	# specify data container (custom interpolation points x and y)
	x = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 2])
	y = np.array([0, 0.8, 1, 1.2])
	he.set_attr(kA_char1=hlp.dc_cc(method='EVA_HOT', param='m', x=x, y=y))


Component characteristics
-------------------------

Characteristics are available for the following components and parameters:

- pump (isentropic efficiency, not customizable at the moment, pressure rise vs. volumetric flow characteristic, customizable)
- compressor (component map for isentropic efficiency and pressure rise, not customizable at the moment)
- turbine (isentropic efficiency, various predefined methods and specification parameters, customizable)
- heat exchangers (heat transfer coefficient, various predefined types, mass flows as specification parameters, customizable)
- simple heat exchangers (e. g. pipe, see heat exchangers)

There are two ways for specifying the customizable characteristic line of a component.
You can specify the method directly by stating the methods name or you define the whole data container for this parameter.

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import cmp, hlp
	
	turb = cmp.turbine('turbine')
	# method specification
	turb.set_attr(eta_s_char='TRAUPEL')	
	# data container specification
	turb.set_attr(eta_s_char=hlp.dc_cc(method='TRAUPEL', param='dh_s', x=None, y=None))
	
	# defining a custom line
	x = np.array([0, 1, 2])
	y = np.array([0.95, 1, 0.95])
	turb.set_attr(eta_s_char=hlp.dc_cc(method='TRAUPEL', param='dh_s', x=x, y=y)
	
	# heat exchanger analogously
	he = cmp.heat_exchanger('evaporator')
	he.set_attr(kA_char1='EVA_HOT')
	he.set_attr(kA_char2='EVA_COLD')
	
Turbines, pumps (isentropic efficiency characteristic) and heat exchangers are supplied with default characteristic lines, which can be found in the :py:class:`documentation <tespy.components.characteristics>`.

Custom components
-----------------

If required, you can add custom components. These components should inherit from tespy.components.components class or its children.
In order to do that, create a python file in your working directory and import the tespy.components.components module. The most important methods are

- :code:`attr(self)`,
- :code:`attr_prop(self)`,
- :code:`inlets(self)`,
- :code:`outlets(self)`,
- :code:`equations(self)`,
- :code:`derivatives(self, nw)` and
- :code:`calc_parameters(self, nw, mode)`,

where :code:`nw` is a tespy.networks.network object.

The starting lines of your file would look like this:

.. code:: python
	
	from tespy import cmp
	
	
	class my_custom_component(cmp.component):
	
	
Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

The attr method must return a list with strings in it. These are the attributes you can specify when you want to parametrize your component.
The attr_prop method returns a dictionary with the same keys as the elements in the attr method. The values for each key are the type of data_container this parameter should hold.

.. code:: python

	def attr(self):
		return ['par1', 'par2']
		
	def attr_prop(self):
		return {'par1': dc_cp(), 'par2': dc_cc()}


Inlets and outlets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`inlets(self)` and :code:`outlets(self)` respectively must return a list of strings. The list may look like this:

.. code:: python

	def inlets(self):
		return ['in1', 'in2']

	def outlets(self):
		return ['out1', 'out2']

The number of inlets and outlets might even be generic, e. g. if you have added an attribute :code:`'num_in'` in :code:`attr(self)`:

.. code:: python

    def inlets(self):
        if self.num_in_set:
            return ['in' + str(i + 1) for i in range(self.num_in)]
        else:
            self.set_attr(num_in=2)
            return self.inlets()

Equations
^^^^^^^^^

The equations contain the information on the changes to the fluid properties within the component. Each equation must be defined in a way, that the correct result is zero, e. g.:

.. math::

	0 = \dot{m}_{in} - \dot{m}_{out}\\
	0 = \dot{p}_{in} - \dot{p}_{out} - \Delta p
	
The connections connected to your component are available as a list in :code:`self.inl` and :code:`self.outl` respectively.

.. code:: python

    def equations(self):
	
    	vec_res = []
		
		vec_res += [self.inl[0].m.val_SI - self.outl[0].m.val_SI]
		vec_res += [self.inl[0].p.val_SI - self.outl[0].p.val_SI - self.dp()]

The equations are added to a list one after another, which will be returned at the end.

Derivatives
^^^^^^^^^^^
	
You need to calculate the partial derivatives of the equations to all variables of the network.
This means, that you have to calculate the partial derivatives to mass flow, pressure, enthalpy and all fluids in the fluid vector on each incomming or outgoing connection of the component.

Add all derivatives to a list (in the same order as the equations) and return the list as numpy array (:code:`np.asarray(list)`).
The derivatives can be calculated analytically or numerically by using the inbuilt function :code:`ddx_func(self, func, dx, pos)`.

- :code:`func` is the function you want to calculate the derivatives for,
- :code:`dx` is the variable you want to calculate the derivative to and
- :code:`pos` indicates the connection you want to calculate the derivative for, e. g. :code:`pos=1` means, that counting your inlets and outlets from low index to high index (first inlets, then outlets),
  the connection to be used is the second connection in that list.

For a good start just look into the source code of the inbuilt components. If you have further questions feel free to contact us.


.. _tespy_subsystems_label:


TESPy subsystems/component groups
=================================

Usage
-----

Subsystems are an easy way to add frequently used component groups such as a drum with evaporator or a preheater with desuperheater to your system.
You can use the predefined subsystems or :ref:`create a subsytem yourself <tespy_subsystems_label>`. Every subsystem must have two interfaces, an inlet interface and an outlet interface.
These interfaces have a variable number of connections, which can be connected with the rest of your network. The example below uses the predefined subsystem preheater with desuperheater (:code:`ph_desup_cond()`).
The subsystems interfaces are subsystem.inlet and subsystem.outlet, both with two connections. All connections (and components) of the subsystem have to be added to the network in order to start a simulation.
This can easily be done by adding the whole subsystem object to your network.

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import subsys, cmp
	ext = cmp.source(label='extraction steam')
	cond = cmp.sink(label='condensate')
	fwc = cmp.source(label='feed water cold')
	fww = cmp.sink(label='feed water warm')

	# a preheater with desuperheater part
	preheater = subsys.ph_desup(label='sub1')

	# connections into the subsystem are attached to subsystem.inlet, connections out of the subsystem to subsystem.outlet
	ext_pre = connection(ext, 'out1', subsystem.inlet, 'in1')
	pre_cond = connection(subsystem.outlet, 'out1', cond, 'in1')
	fwc_pre = connection(fwc, 'out1',subsystem.inlet,'in2')
	pre_fwc = connection(subsystem.outlet, 'out2', fww, 'in1')
	
	# parametrisation
	preheater.set_attr(ttd=8, pr1_desup=1, pr2_desup=1, pr1_cond=1, pr2_cond=1)
	
	ext_pre.set_attr(m=5, p=4, h=29e5, fluid={'water': 1})
	fwc_pre.set_attr(p=50, h=3e5, fluid={'water': 1})
	pre_fwc.set_attr(p0=50)

	# create the network and connections and subsystems
	my_plant.add_conns(ext_pre, pre_cond, fwc_pre, pre_fwc)
	my_plant.add_subsys(subsys)

Custom subsystems
-----------------

You can use subsystems in order to represent groups of different components. These are highly customizable and thus a very powerful tool, if you require to use specific component groups frequently.
You will learn how to create your own subsystems. Create a .py file in your working-directory with the class-definition of your custom subsystem. This usually includes the following methods:

- :code:`attr`: list of subsystem attributes,
- :code:`create_comps`: define the number of interfaces and create the necessary components,
- :code:`set_comps`: parametrize the components with the defined attributes from :code:`attr`,
- :code:`create_conns`: create the subsystems topology and
- :code:`set_conns`: parametrize them.

The following section shows, how the different functions of a subsystem can be defined. The code is taken from the subsystem drum with evaporator and natural flow.

Your file will start with the following lines:

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import con, cmp, subsys
	

	class dr_eva_natural (subsys.subsystem):

Add the attr method:

.. code-block:: python
	
	def attr(self):
		# define available attributes for subsystem
		# num_i and num_o are excluded, as they are predefined in this subsystem
		return ([n for n in subsys.subsystem.attr(self) if
				 n != 'num_i' and n != 'num_o'] +
				['dp1_eva', 'PP', 'circ_num'])

Create the components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The inlet and the outlet of the subsystem must be an attribute of the subsystem in order to reference to these when you are creating a network and want to connect the subsystem to the rest of the network.

.. code-block:: python

	def create_comps(self):
		# create the components

		self.num_i = 2
		self.num_o = 2
		self.inlet = cmp.subsys_interface(label=self.label + '_inlet',
										  num_inter=self.num_i)
		self.outlet = cmp.subsys_interface(label=self.label + '_outlet',
										   num_inter=self.num_o)
		self.drum = cmp.drum(label=self.label + '_drum')
		self.evaporator = cmp.heat_exchanger(label=self.label + '_evaporator',
											 mode='man')

As specific attributes refer to specific components in the subsystem, it is necessery, that the evaporator is stored as attribute of the subsystem as well. Else it would not be possible to set values for the parametrization.

Parametrize the components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

	def set_comps(self):
		# set component parameters

		self.evaporator.set_attr(ttd_l=self.PP)
		self.evaporator.set_attr(pr1=self.pr1_eva)

Create the connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a list called :code:`self.conns` and add the connections to that list.

.. code-block:: python

	def create_conns(self):
		# create the connections

		self.conns = []

		self.conns += [con.connection(self.inlet, 'out1', self.evaporator, 'in1')]
		self.conns += [con.connection(self.evaporator, 'out1', self.outlet, 'in1')]
		self.conns += [con.connection(self.inlet, 'out2', self.drum, 'in1')]
		self.conns += [con.connection(self.drum, 'out1', self.evaporator, 'in2')]
		self.conns += [con.connection(self.evaporator, 'out2', self.drum, 'in2')]
		self.conns += [con.connection(self.drum, 'out2', self.outlet, 'in2')]

Parametrize the connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connection gets a ref object as attribute, thus it is necessary to look, if the subsystems attribute is set or not.
For parametrization with specific values simply use :code:`self.conns[3].set_attr(m=self.mass_flow)`. :code:`self.mass_flow` must be a subsystem attribute in this example.

.. code-block:: python

	def set_conns(self):
		# set connection parameters

		if self.circ_num_set:
			self.conns[3].set_attr(m=con.ref(self.conns[-1], self.circ_num, 0))
		else:
			self.conns[3].set_attr(m=np.nan)

Add more felxibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to add even more flexibility, you might need to manipulate the :code:`__init__()` method.
For example, if you want a variable number of inlets and outlets because you have a variable number of components groups within your subsystem,
you may introduce an attribute which is set on initialisation and lets you create and parametrize components and connections generically.
This might be very interesting for district heating systems, turbines with several sections of equal topology, etc..
For a good start, you can have a look into the sub_consumer.py at the `tespy_examples repository <https://github.com/fwitte/tespy_examples/tree/master/district_heating>`_.


TESPy connections
=================

This section provides an overview of the parametrisation of connections, the usage of references and busses (connections for energy flow).

Parametrisation
---------------

As mentioned in the introduction, for each connection you can specify the following parameters:

 * mass flow* (m),
 * pressure* (p),
 * enthalpy* (h),
 * temperature* (T),
 * vapour mass fraction for pure fluids (x),
 * a fluid vector (fluid) and
 * a balance closer for the fluid vector (fluid_balance).
 
It is possible to specify values, starting values, references and data containers. The data containers for connections are dc_prop for fluid properties (mass flow, pressure, enthalpy, temperature and vapour mass fraction)
and dc_flu for fluid composition. You need to import the :code:`hlp` module, if you want to specify data_containers.

.. code-block:: python
	
	# set pressure and vapour mass fraction by value, temperature and enthalpy analogously
	myconn.set_attr(p=7, x=0.5)
	
	# set starting values for mass flow, pressure and enthalpy (has no effect on temperature and vapour mass fraction!)
	myconn.set_attr(m0=10, p0=15, h0=100)
	
	# do the same with a data container
	myconn.set_attr(p=hlp.dc_prop(val=7, val_set=True), x=hlp.dc_prop(val=0.5, val_set=True))
	myconn.set_attr(m=hlp.dc_prop(val0=10), p=hlp.dc_prop(val0=15), h=hlp.dc_prop(val0=100))
	
	# specify a value in a different unit for a specific parameter
	myconn.set_attr(p=hlp.dc_prop(val=7, val_set=True, unit='MPa', unit_set=True)
	
	# specify a referenced value: pressure of myconn is 1.2 times pressure at myotherconn minus 5 Pa (always SI unit here)
	myconn.set_attr(p=con.ref(myotherconn, 1.2, -5))
	
	# specify value and reference at the same time
	myconn.set_attr(p=hlp.dc_prop(val=7, val_set=True, ref=con.ref(myotherconn, 1.2, -5), ref_set=True))	
	
	# unset value and reference
	myconn.set_attr(p=np.nan)
	myconn.p.set_attr(val_set=False, ref_set=False)
	
If you want to specify the fluid vector you can do it in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

	# set both elements of the fluid vector	
	myconn.set_attr(fluid={'water': 1, 'air': 0})
	# same thing, but using data container
	myconn.set_attr(fluid=dc_flu(val={'water': 1, 'air': 0}, val_set:{'water': True, 'air': True}))
	
	# set starting values
	myconn.set_attr(fluid0={'water': 1, 'air': 0})
	# same thing, but using data container
	myconn.set_attr(fluid=dc_flu(val0={'water': 1, 'air': 0}))
	
	# unset values
	myconn.fluid.set_attr(val_set={'water': False, 'air': False})
	
References can not be used for fluid composition at the moment!
	
	
Busses
------

Busses can be used to add up the power of different turbomachinery or to add up heat flow of different heat exchangers within your network.
The handling is very similar to connections and components. You need to add components to your busses as a list containing the component object and a factor, the power of the component will be multiplied with.
Do not forget to add the busses to you network.

This can be used for easy post processing, e. g. to calculate thermal efficiency or you can build up relations between components in your network.
If you want to use the busses for postprocessing only, you do not specify the sum of the power or heat flux on your bus.
If you set a value for P (equal parameter for heat flux or power), an additional equation will be added to your network.
This could be useful, e. g. for establishing relations between different components, for instance when using a steam turbine powered feed water pump.
In the code example the power of the turbine and the feed water pump is added up and set to zero, as the turbines and feed water pumps power have to be equal in absolute value but have different sign.
The sign can be manipulated, e. g. in order to design two turbines with equal power output.

.. code-block:: python
	
	from tespy import nwk, con
	
	...
	
	fwp_bus = con.bus('feed water pump', P=0) # set a value for the total power on this bus.
	fwp_bus.add_comps([turbine_fwp, 1], [fwp, 1])
	
	turbine_bus = con.bus('turbines', P=0) # set a value for the total power on this bus
	turbine_bus.add_comps([turbine_hp, 1], [turbine_lp, -1])
	# the values for the busses power can be altered by using .set_attr()
	
	power = con.bus('power output') # bus for postprocessing, no power (or heat flux) specified
	power.add_comps([turbine_hp, 1], [turbine_lp, 1])
	
	my_network.add_busses(fwp_bus, turbine_bus, power)
	
Two labels for busses have a predefined function in the postprocessing analysis: 'P_res' and 'Q_diss'.
If you specify these labels for your busses, 'P_res' will be interpreted as the total power of your process and 'Q_diss' as total amount of dissipated heat flow (from the process, not internally).
Given these key figures, thermal efficiency or COP will be calculated and an entropy analysis for your systems components will be performed.*

*Planned feature, not implemented yet!

	
How can TESPy contribute to your energy system calculations?
============================================================

In this part you learn how you can use TESPy for your energy system calculations: In energy system calculations, for instance in oemof-solph, plants are usually modelled as abstract components on a much lower level of detail.
In order to represent a plant within an abstract component it is possible to supply characteristics establishing a connection between your energy system model and a specific plant model.
Thus the characteristics are a representation of a specific plant layout in terms of topology and process parameters. In the examples section we have an example of a heat pump COP at different loads and ambient temperatures
as well as a CHP unit with backpressure turbine operating at different loads and varying feed flow temperatures of a heating system.


.. _tespy_fluid_properties_label:

Fluid properties in TESPy
=========================

The basic fluid properties are handled by `CoolProp <http://www.coolprop.org/>`_. All available fluids can be found on their homepage. 

Pure and pseudo-pure fluids
---------------------------

If you use pure fluids, TESPy directly uses CoolProp functions to gather all fluid properties.
CoolProp covers the most important fluids such as water, air as a pseudo-pure fluid as well as its components, several fuels and refrigerants etc..
Look for the aliases in the `list of fluids <http://www.coolprop.org/fluid_properties/PurePseudoPure.html#list-of-fluids>`_. All fluids provided in this list cover liquid and gaseous state and the two-phase region.

Incompressible fluids
---------------------

If you are looking for heat transer fluids, the `list of incompressible fluids <http://www.coolprop.org/fluid_properties/Incompressibles.html>`_ might be interesting for you.
In contrast to the pure fluids, the properties cover liquid state only.

Fluid mixtures
--------------

CoolProp provides fluid properties for two component mixtures. BUT: These are NOT integrated in TESPy! Nevertheless, you can use fluid mixtures for gases:

Ideal mixtures of gaseous fluids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TESPy can handle mixtures of gaseous fluids, by using the single fluid properties from CoolProp together with corresponding equations for mixtures.
The equations can be found in the :py:mod:`tespy.helpers module <tespy.helpers>` and are applied automatically to the fluid vector.

Other mixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is **not possible** to use mixtures of liquid and other liquid or gaseous fluids **at the moment**!
If you try to use a mixture of two liquid or gaseous fluids and liquid fluids, e. g. water and methanol or liquid water and air, the equations will still be applied, but obviously return bad values.
If you have ideas for the implementation of new kinds of mixtures we appreciate you contacting us.
